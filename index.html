        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">I am an imaginary character created by Dania Masoud for the purpose of pacticing building websites using the coding languages: html, css and javascript. My creator, Dania, named me Orange because of her deep love towards oranges. I am a senior student who had lived in Fruitork City since birth. I was born on the third of Neverary 7020, which means that I am only 5000 years old. In this website, you will learn more about me. Have fun!</p>

          <h3>Painting</h3>
          <p>Painting has always been one of my favorite things to do. My friend Watermelon says that my artistic abilities can create a masterpiece that is better than the monalisa. I think she is exaggerating, however this does not change the fact that I really love painting!</p>

          <h3>Singing</h3>
          <p>Although I have had a nice gentle voice since I was a child, I discovered my love towards singing just recently. My vocal coach says that my voice is like honey; it is very sweet. I plan to keep singing for the rest of my life. Hopefully I could convince my parents so that they won't have a problem with me singing in the middle of the night :) </p>
